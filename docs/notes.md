# Todo

-   Personal organization should have a different panel
-   It will focus on individual records
    -- pt tests
    -- trainings + certs
    -- leave
    -- etc

-   Buildings will have work orders for INTERNAL tracking
    -- work order will still have to be filed with an external agency, but this provides visibity to internal users

-   Need to build logic in for pending pt tests, after they are "activated" it turns it into a "fitness test" and deletes the record
    it should also capture what record id it was turned into.
-   Need a way to "push" the test date and state why it was pushed (TDY, profille, etc.)

-   Should leave requests and appointments be scoped to the individual or the organization?
    -- I am leaning towards organization...

- Other personal resources
-- security clearance info (synced w/DISS ideally)
--- eligibily level
--- investigation type
--- investigation date
--- current accesses + who granted them
